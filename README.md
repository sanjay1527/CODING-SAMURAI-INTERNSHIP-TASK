# CODING SAMURAI INTERNSHIP TASK

## Project 4: Number Guessing Game with GUI

### Description
An ultra-immersive number guessing game built with Python Tkinter featuring:
- Dynamic color-changing interface based on proximity
- Progressive difficulty levels
- Scoring system with streaks
- Animated visual effects
- Strategic hint system

### Features
- 🔥 Hot/Cold color feedback system
- 🎮 Progressive difficulty with level system
- 🏆 Scoring and streak tracking
- 💡 Strategic hint system
- 🎨 Beautiful animated UI
- ⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts

### How to Run
```bash
python number_guessing_game.py
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes with Python)

### Game Instructions
1. Run the Python file
2. Enter your guess in the input field
3. Watch the interface change colors based on how close you are:

   - 🟠 **ORANGE** = Close (Hot!)
   - 🟡 **YELLOW** = Warm
   - 🔵 **BLUE** = Cool/Cold
   - 🟣 **PURPLE** = Very far (Frozen!)
4. Use hints strategically (they cost points!)
5. Build winning streaks to level up!
